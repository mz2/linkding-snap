# linkding-snap

This repository contains snap packaging for the [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) bookmark manager.

The app is available on [snapcraft.io/linkding](https://snapcraft.io/linkding) (`sudo snap install linkding --channel=beta` at the time of writing).

You can build and install the snap also locally [after installing snapcraft and a build provider for it](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-setup):

```bash
snapcraft
sudo snap install linkding_*.snap --dangerous
```
